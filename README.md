# 🏧ATM-System

##  💡Project Idea
This project is a simple ATM System written in C++.
It asks the user to enter their Account Number and Pin Code, then checks if the user exists in a local text file (Client.txt).

If the login is successful, the ATM displays five main operations:
- 1 Quick Withdraw
- 2 Normal Withdraw
- 3 Deposit
- 4 Check Balance
- 5 Logout

 Each operation updates the user's balance and saves the new data back to the Client.txt file.
## Purpose:
  This project is mainly for practicing:
  - Basic C++ syntax
  - enum and struct usage
  - Functions and parameter passing
  - Console output formatting
  - Conditional statements
